        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bravery</li>
        <li>Confidence</li>
        <li>Honesty</li>
        <li>Commitment</li>
        <li>Strength</li>
    </ul>
